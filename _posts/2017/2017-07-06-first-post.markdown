My name is Roland and I am a data scientist; or at least I am trying to be. Over the next few months I will be blogging about my journey into the exciting new space of data and data accessories.

Most of my professional experience comes from working as a Java developer in the full stack and consulting flavors, but my real love has always been data analysis. I learned to code as an undergrad while getting my physics degree at the University of Maryland. Back then I worked with languages like [ROOT](https://root.cern.ch/) and [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) to do most of my visualizations, and spent an ungodly amount of time working with Excel. A lot has changed since then and I intend to catch-up.

This blog is going to focus on machine learning and visualizations using the Python library [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org/) (as well as some additional Python libraries). I will also dive into the more complicated problem of making custom dynamic visualization with javascript libraries like [D3](https://d3js.org/).

So until next time...
